## Project milestones

### Phase 1 January - February 2015

Recruitment of Sessional Worker  - William Harvie has joined us as out Historical Connections Worker. William is an experience member of the Community Development Team having worked with us on placement in 2013. He is passionate about Local History and has already proven to be a great asset to the team!

### Phase 2 February - March 2015

Make up local history kits to be used in classes, use sample family trees, documents and photographs 

Open days and events aimed at recruiting members to join the groups: We recently attended our Supported Housing Focus Day at the Science Centre and had a chance to show a wide range of tenants some of the photos and stories we have seen and heard so far. More than 35 people signed up to take part in classes as a result of this day. We have also been attending events and open days held by other parts of the organisation to promote the project. 

Marketing launched


### Phase 3 March 2015

Begin sessions. 

Primary focus on familiarizing members with devices, basic internet awareness, internet safety etc. We have now started four Historical Connections groups with a second wave of three new groups starting the first week in September.

Establish blog and write sample content to inspire learners, establish plan for blogging and content with Communications Team. Our blog has been created and new content is being added weekly, this will soon be ready to share.

### Phase 4 April to September 2015

Genealogical research begins â€“ familiarize learners with the tools required and the recording possibilities. We started using the Ancestry.co.uk App and working with learners to become more comfortable at using this.

Encourage some brief blogs about experience of using the internet to research family history. Using the blogging page was perhaps too ambitious, but we started to blog on behalf of the project and this model has proved more effective.

Start to collect photographs and videos to create history map and blogposts. 

Liaise with Youth Work Coordinator re working within the Youth Clubs, look at ways in which the Young People and Older People might work together.

Establish a project plan for working with Young People in Youth Clubs and begin work with them.

### Phase 5 September 2015 to January 2016

We are now running sessions in six locations across the Queens Cross Area. Members of our groups are enjoying building their family trees and sharing memories with each other. 

Encourage learners to share their stories and findings via the blog. The blog is now up and running with entries being posted by William and written in conjunction with the groups.

Bring together Older and Younger learners. We are currently working with a Youth Group in Woodside Library for Historical Connections. We have been using computers to research the history of the area and also looking at some of the images displayed in the library to spark our discussion.

We are planning a cross-generational event to bring together the two types of group and share memories across the years.
### Phase 6 December 2015 to January 2016 

Devise action plan to seek further funding to make project sustainable for the longer term. We are starting to consider plans to continue the project and seek further funding.

Recruit Digital Ambassadors from groups for further training to then support the groups digitally. We have two Digital Ambassadors working on Historical Connections, one of whom is involved with the Young People and one who will be starting with the groups in Sheltered Housing.
